/**
 * Probabilistic duplicate filter: a fixed table of slots, one entry each, over SipHash-2-4-128 digests keyed at random per filter.
 * The lower half of a digest picks its slot and an entry keeps a 48-bit tag from the upper half, so two different inputs count as the same one only when they share both; an input already seen passes again once another digest takes its slot, which a larger table makes rarer.
 * An input is its bytes together with a domain, a number the caller picks to say what the bytes are, so the same bytes in two domains are two inputs.
 * Entries age in epochs the owner moves forward with advance () rather than in clock time, which spares every insert a clock read. An entry keeps the low 16 bits of the epoch it went in at, which tells its age for one lap of those bits, so the owner clears the filter when advance () reports that they have wrapped.
 * Thread-safe without a lock. An entry is one atomic word replaced with a compare and swap, so of several threads inserting one digest at once exactly one is told it is new. Only clear () is loose about what runs alongside it: an insert made during a clear may or may not be left in the table.
